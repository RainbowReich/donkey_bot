# donkey_bot
My custom Twitch chat bot

Experimenting with making custom commands and interactions for myself, rather than selling out and using Nightbot
or something similar DansGame

### Current priorities

1. Refactor out the notified channel and messages to not point to my channel specifically
2. Restructure `run.py` to be a bit more function-oriented
3. Add tests/documentation
4. Add new features and other fun stuff!

### To see donkey_bot in action

Check out my [Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/thermaldonkey) when I go live (donkey_bot is disabled
when I'm offline). I always [tweet](https://twitter.com/_thermaldonkey) when I start a broadcast.

### Contributing

Feel free to fork and send me pull requests with features you think would be cool!
